The objective of this lab is to create a login screen that will pass a user name between view controllers. You'll use view controllers, a navigation controller, and segues to create both the login screen and a simple landing screen that will display in its title either the user name or text related to a forgotten user name or password.

Create an outlet from each of the two remaining buttons (the Forgot User Name button and the Forgot Password button), and give them descriptive names like "forgotUserNameButton."Create an action from each of the buttons.Within each action, call performSegue(withIdentifier:, sender:), passing the identifier of the most recently created segue. Instead of setting sender to nil, set sender to be the button that was tapped. For example, if the segue identifier is ForgottenUserNameOrPassword and the outlet of the Forgot User Name button is forgotUserNameButton, then the inside of the button's action might look as follows: performSegue(withIdentifier: "ForgottenUsernameOrPassword",sender: forgotUsernameButton)

an if statement checks whether sender was forgotPasswordButton and sets the title accordingly. If sender was not forgotPasswordButton, another if statement checks whether sender was forgotUserNameButton and sets the title accordingly. If sender was not forgotPasswordButton, there's only one remaining case—when the login button was tapped—which sets the title to the user name.
